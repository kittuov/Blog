                    <article>Kshitij is the annual techno-management fest of IIT Kharagpur,one of the India’s premier technical institutions. Started in the year 2004, the idea of Kshitij was conceived with the aim to provide the technically inclined youth a national-level platform, where their talent and expertise would be recognized and duly rewarded. Having grown exponentially since its nascent years, Kshitij receives overwhelming participation from the student community all over the world. The official website of Kshitij, ktj.in, is in fact the largest student run website, receiving 8 million clicks in its previous edition.</article>

  <em>......</em><br/>
  <em>&ldquo;7 in the morning,  young Ismail runs down the back alley. His skinny appearance and torn clothes  tells the story of a war that never should have happened. His breath may be  failing him but those tiny legs refuse to stop. His anxiety grows by the  minute. And there he is finally...the moment of truth. Nothing but a rubble of  stone and concrete charred to the hilt. Here and there, torn and half burnt  books lie in the dust. News reporters and locals crowd the premises as they too  witness the destruction caused by the shelling last night. That is all that  remains of a school set up by the United Nations which happens to be Ismail&rsquo;s  school. It happens to be the latest casualty of the long drawn conflict between  the Israeli army and Hamas. As small drops brim over his eyes, all his hopes  over the last three weeks of returning to school vanish with the smoke rising  from the debris. For him the future seems bleak but it&rsquo;s the ruthless present  that he is worried about. With education out of question, the chances of being  drawn into the cycle of resistance which may see him dead in the prime of his  life seems a reality now.&rdquo;</em><br />
  <em>......</em><br />
  Life in Palestine has always been unstable; people like Ismàil  is not a minority nor an exception. With bomber planes flying overhead and the  sound of shelling echoes with your every heartbeat, life becomes hell. People  started migrating to nearby countries for food, employment and medical  facilities with little hope that their hosts will be kind to them. Turning  dreams of education, employment and a peaceful life into a burning pile of  rubble.<br />
  <br />
  May it be the ethnic violence in South Sudan, or Drug Cartel in Mexico, or  Syrian Civil war, or America invading Iraq for oil, all these scenarios  reflects the dark face of humanity. Times changed from wooden spears to nuclear  weapons and biological warheads, technology evolved only to pave way to a  better and convenient source to overpower; rarely to satisfy needs and often to  quench needless ambitions.<br>
  <img width="398" height="265" src="/static/images/peace.jpg" alt="peace.jpg" /><br />
<h1>The Indian Struggle</h1>
<p>India has been no different in the struggle against this  evil. Home to global icons like Mahatma Gandhi and Mother Teresa who paved way  of non-violence, benevolence and compassion, India has resisted to fall victim  to the evil of war and its causalities. Little did we know that what replaced  the void was even more terrifying, dangerous enough to rip apart the nation&rsquo;s  future and it&rsquo;s present.<br />
  <em>......</em><br />
  <em>&ldquo;7 in the morning,  Kushal feels a gentle nudge. Waking up to the welcome sight of an old nurse,  Kushal looks around to find the other children yawning. The events of the  previous day are still vague in his mind. All that he remembers and understands  is that a few people dropped by and after a long heated argument with his  master they left only to return back, this time with police. Too sleepy to  realise who these people were, he just went on with them, assuming they were  the elders and they had woke him up for some late night work.&rdquo;</em><br />
  <em>......</em><br />
  The inhumane living conditions and the long exhausting  working hours still haunts Kushal and many other children like himself. With  food as a luxury available maybe twice a day, there are days when children are  starved. Child labour has become a vice that India has started to dread deeply.  With physical and mental abuse a daily routine these young minds provide  breeding grounds for anti-social elements which later may even be moulded into  terrorism. Only a fortunate few make it out of this dark hole. Some succumb to  the harshness of the system, and others to the temptation to the break the system.<br />
  Apart from child labour, cases of rape and molestation have  increases manifold in India in recent times. Naxalism at a time believed to be  suppressed have swung back in full speed too. Substance abuse and communal  violence have also caused chaos in the system. Like salt on a fresh wound,  corruption has deepened the wounds, causing even more pain and suffering.</p>
  <img width="398" height="265" src="/static/images/indian struggle.jpg" alt="indianstruggle.jpg" /><br />
<h1>Humanity Fights Back</h1>
<p>The youth of the country are, however, becoming increasingly  more aware about these issues and have started to protest against the weak laws  which provide loopholes to the convicted. The recent protest for the Nirbhaya  rape case is an excellent example of this increasing awareness and intolerance  towards injustice among the youth.<br />
  Militants are created from poor accessibility of government  facilities in certain areas leading to their poverty. Though the ideal solution  of this problem should have been the intervention of government for the  betterment of their lives, the anger of the poor tribes has unfortunately  invited extreme measures and resulted in what we see today.<br />
  <em>......</em><br />
  <em>&ldquo;Little had Kushal  realised that it was going to be the last day of his slavery. The inhumane  living conditions and the long exhausting working hours will still haunt him  for many years to come. Life as a labour had been nothing like what he had been  told by the agents who lured him into it. Food was a luxury available only  twice a day, that too if they were lucky. There were days when they would not  be given food even once, if they didn&rsquo;t work hard enough. Shouting and beating  from the masters had become almost a daily affair. They specially dreaded the  days when the masters where in foul mood or sometimes just particularly drunk.  He came to know that they were rescued and rehabilitated by an organisation  called <strong>&ldquo;Bachpan Bachao Andolan&rdquo;</strong>. He  realised that they were not the only ones. The streets of Delhi were filled  with such factories whose glamour at the market came at the price of the lives  of children such as himself.</em><br />
  <em>A week later, he was  watching TV happily with his newly made friends. The face of their father  figure on TV filled his heart with joy.&rdquo;</em><br />

<h1><br />
  Icons to Inspire – Nobel Prize for Peace 2014</h1>
<p>The Bachpan Bachao Andolan is less known to the people of  India, its founder even lesser. Founded in 1980 by the man with a golden heart, <strong><em>Kailash  Satyarthi</em></strong>, the Bachpan Bachao Andolan has been rescuing and  rehabilitating children under bonded labour since the last 25 years. As a boy,  Satyarthi was moved by other children who had to work due to poor financial  condition of their parents and couldn&rsquo;t attend school as a result. He started a  football club with membership fees paying the school fees of needy children, a  project that eventually became a book bank in his town.In 1994, he founded a group  now known as Goodweave, which certifies child-labor-free rugs and provides  assistance to rescued and at-risk children. In 1998, Satyarthi was chairman of  a global march against child labour that wound through more than 60 countries  around the world.<br />
  The mere fact that how less the people of India know him,  and how less media coverage he got despite such great work shows his humility  and selflessness. The Nobel Prize win brought him to the limelight, but it was  never his aim.<br />
  He shared it with <strong><em>Malala Yousafzali</em></strong>, another icon who  advocated the importance of education to all, in spite of threats from Taliban.  Having gone through tremendous suffering and humiliation at a very small age,  her determination is a huge motivation to anyone who knows her. Starting her  journey with the aim of providing education to Pakistani girls, her incident  has sparked a global campaign for girl child education.<br />
  &ldquo;One teacher, one student, one book, and one pen can change  the world.&rdquo; This quote by Malala strongly conveys the importance of education  in the betterment of the lives of girls by making them independent.</p>

<h1>The Ripples of Change</h1>
<p>The people have started to reflect on their actions and look  at their fellow beings. Organisations such as the Bachpan Bachao Andolan which  work against child labour nationally as well as internationally. ActionAid,&nbsp;Oxfam&nbsp;and&nbsp;Education  International are the front-runners in the global march against child labour.  We are proud to have these organisations and support them, but we should also  feel ashamed of the reason why they are needed.<br />
  There are numerous organisations working hand in hand to  global peace. Nuclear warfare, war and its casualties, terrorism have all been  in the cross-hair of these organisations. The extent to which violence and war  has affected the lives of this generation is horrifying, yet the heroic efforts  put in by people to rise up against this, fills every soul with hope and  determination. Deeply affected by this everlasting conflict between peace and  violence the world is going through at present, Kshitij has decided to take  forward this worldwide campaign. </p>

<h1>Kharagpur – The Land of &lsquo;Peace&rsquo;</h1>
<p>The word &lsquo;peace&rsquo; has a very special significance in the life  of KGPians. Going beyond its usual meaning, this word is used in all aspects of  life of a KGPian. Be it exams, parents, sports, cultural activities or any  other such thing. &lsquo;Peace&rsquo; is not just the calmness of mind anymore, rather it&rsquo;s  a way of life. Feeling at ease and in harmony with everyone around you, filled  with compassion and free of all tensions one is truly at &lsquo;peace&rsquo; in IIT  Kharagpur. Inspired by the population and life at IIT Kharagpur, Kshitij brings  you &lsquo;The Peace Campaign&rsquo;. <br />
  We encourage the youth of India to stand up and raise their voices  against the depravities that torture our society. We hope that every voice will  echo through the system and their ripples will become waves of change in the  future. Quoting the legend MJ, &ldquo;Make it a better place, for you and for me and  the entire human race&rdquo;.</p>

                        <p>Imagine what would happen if time slowed down for you ? You wouldn’t know that you were moving and acting slower. Everything around you would be moving like a movie in fast-forward mode.Or imagine if you could actually travel backward in time like say 2 hours per hour, or 10 or 100 years per hour? Or imagine that some day you met yourself ? <br>
  Seems too confusing ! Its not only for you. These questions made scientists go nuts for centuries until the year 1905 when one man who proposed the answers to all these. Thanks to <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> with his famous Theory of Relativity.</p>
<p>Wait..!<br>
  But how did <strong><em>Einstein</em></strong> think up the theory of relativity? Did an apple fall on his head too as Isaac Newton? <br>
  It all started when he was just 16. Einstein imagined chasing after a beam of light with a velocity equal to that of the latter. And if he could catch up and be moving with it like a surfer riding the wave, he would actually see a frozen lightwave. The untenability of that thought led to the downfall of the great achievement of nineteenth century physics and provided the base for the Theory of Relativity.<br>
  Newton's theory of gravitation was soon accepted without question, and it remained unquestioned until the beginning of this century. Then Albert Einstein shook the foundations of physics with the introduction of his Special Theory of Relativity in 1905, and his General Theory of Relativity in 1915. The theory of relativity, or simply relativity in physics, usually encompasses two theories by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity. <br>
  Special relativity is a theory of the structure of spacetime. It was introduced in Einstein's 1905 paper &quot;On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies&quot;.General relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Einstein in the years 1907–1915. The development of general relativity began with the equivalence principle, under which the states of accelerated motion and being at rest in a gravitational field (for example when standing on the surface of the Earth) are physically identical.<br>
  And that stands till the present day. Our best current theory of gravitation is the General Theory of Relativity. However, only if velocities are comparable to that of light, or gravitational fields are much larger than those encountered on the Earth, do the Relativity theory and Newton's theories differ in their predictions. Under most conditions Newton's three laws and his theory of gravitation are adequate.</p>
<p>Nowadays life is unimaginable if Einstein didn't propose the theory of relativity. From GPS to nuclear power stations or Quantum Physics all everything is in virtue. Credits to the Relativity!!<br>

  Have you ever imagined that time-travel is possible now with the theory of relativity and even research is going on in this field? Some most promising models include <strong><em>string theory</em></strong> and <strong>loop quantum gravity</strong>. Recent advances in gravitation theory and cosmology, combined with breakthroughs in observational astronomy are transforming our understanding of space and time and our perspectives on the origin and future fate of the universe.<br>
  Now when we discuss quantum physics how can we forget the great Physicist <strong>Werner Heisenberg</strong> ??<br>
  Heisenberg is famous for his theory of uncertainty which states that the exact position and velocity of an object can’t be determined simultaneously. Lets have a look:<br>
  What is Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle?</p>
<p>In H.G. Wells’ novel, THE TIME MACHINE, our protagonist jumped into a special chair with blinking lights, spun a few dials, and found himself catapulted several hundred thousand years into the future, where England has long disappeared and is now inhabited by two groups of strange creatures, the Morlocks and the Eloi.That may have made great fiction, but physicists have always scoffed at the idea of time travel, considering it to be the realm of cranks, mystics, and charlatans, and with good reason. However, rather remarkable advances in quantum physics and with Einstein’s theory of relativity, time travel has now become fair game for theoretical physicists.</p>
<p>One stubborn problem with time travel is that it is riddled with several types of paradoxes. For example, there is the paradox of the man with no parents: What happens when you go back in time and kill your parents before you are born? If your parents died before you were born, then how could you have been born to kill them in the first place?<br>
  There is also the paradox of the man with no past. For example, let’s say that a young inventor is trying futilely to build a time machine in his garage. Suddenly, an elderly man appears from nowhere and gives the youth the secret of building a time machine. The young man then becomes enormously rich playing the stock market, race tracks, and sporting events because he knows the future. Then, as an old man, he decides to make his final trip back to the past and give the secret of time travel to his youthful self. Where did the idea of the time machine come from? <br>
  All these seems too confusing…..! Lets look at this video to understand it better.<br>
  Video link: Is time travel possible?<br>
</p>
<p><strong>SCHRODINGER’S CAT</strong> :<br>
  Schrodinger’s cat is a thought experiment, better described as a paradox devised by Erwin Schrodinger. The scenario presents a cat that may be both alive and dead and ultimately discusses three important things:<br>
  1) Our point of view<br>
  2) Cat’s point of view<br>
  3) Natural Uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>In Short:</strong><br>
  A cat is in a bunker with an unstable gunpowder that has 50% probability of blasting and 50% probability of doing nothing. Until we look into bunker, we don’t know whether the cat is dead or alive. And if experiment is repeated several times with many cats, bunkers and bombs, half the time cat survives and the other half, it dies. So, before we look, cat is in a superposition of both dead and alive. But, our act of looking foresees nature’s decision and curiosity kills the cat !<br>
  FInally, we arrive at conclusion that the cat either sees gunpowder exploding or not. But, there is no option in between. So, the cat’s reality expresses the outcome of the experiment. And, it is our observation to pick one option or the other. Either, we see the cat dead or alive. </p>
<p>Check out the video here: Schrodinger's Cat </p>
<p>The things that pop out are:<br>
  •	What’s the cat’s perspective?<br>
  •	Who’s observing to force the nature to collapse to one reality? (or both incidents happening parallel)? -- Infact, these collapsing to one reality is one of the biggest unanswered questions in physics!!<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Criticism Of Relativity:</strong><br>
  The theory of relativity is considered to be self-consistent, is consistent with many experimental results, and serves as the basis of many successful theories like quantum electrodynamics. Therefore, fundamental criticism has not been taken seriously by the scientific community, and due to the lack of quality of many critical publications they were rarely accepted for publication in reputable scientific journals. So, as in 1920s, most of the critical works have been published in small publications houses, alternative journals or private websites. Consequently, where criticism of relativity has been dealt with by the scientific community, it has mostly been in historical studies.</p>
<p>It’s been 100 years since the theory of relativity has been proposed and many advancements have been happening on the basis of the relativity theory. In this regard we celebrate “100 years of Relativity” as our theme for Kshitij 2015, the 12th edition of this Asia’s largest Techno-Management Symposium.</p>
