  <em>......</em><br/>
  <em>&ldquo;7 in the morning,  young Ismail runs down the back alley. His skinny appearance and torn clothes  tells the story of a war that never should have happened. His breath may be  failing him but those tiny legs refuse to stop. His anxiety grows by the  minute. And there he is finally...the moment of truth. Nothing but a rubble of  stone and concrete charred to the hilt. Here and there, torn and half burnt  books lie in the dust. News reporters and locals crowd the premises as they too  witness the destruction caused by the shelling last night. That is all that  remains of a school set up by the United Nations which happens to be Ismail&rsquo;s  school. It happens to be the latest casualty of the long drawn conflict between  the Israeli army and Hamas. As small drops brim over his eyes, all his hopes  over the last three weeks of returning to school vanish with the smoke rising  from the debris. For him the future seems bleak but it&rsquo;s the ruthless present  that he is worried about. With education out of question, the chances of being  drawn into the cycle of resistance which may see him dead in the prime of his  life seems a reality now.&rdquo;</em><br />
  <em>......</em><br />
  Life in Palestine has always been unstable; people like Ismàil  is not a minority nor an exception. With bomber planes flying overhead and the  sound of shelling echoes with your every heartbeat, life becomes hell. People  started migrating to nearby countries for food, employment and medical  facilities with little hope that their hosts will be kind to them. Turning  dreams of education, employment and a peaceful life into a burning pile of  rubble.<br />
  <br />
  May it be the ethnic violence in South Sudan, or Drug Cartel in Mexico, or  Syrian Civil war, or America invading Iraq for oil, all these scenarios  reflects the dark face of humanity. Times changed from wooden spears to nuclear  weapons and biological warheads, technology evolved only to pave way to a  better and convenient source to overpower; rarely to satisfy needs and often to  quench needless ambitions.<br>

<h1>The Indian Struggle</h1>
<p>India has been no different in the struggle against this  evil. Home to global icons like Mahatma Gandhi and Mother Teresa who paved way  of non-violence, benevolence and compassion, India has resisted to fall victim  to the evil of war and its causalities. Little did we know that what replaced  the void was even more terrifying, dangerous enough to rip apart the nation&rsquo;s  future and it&rsquo;s present.<br />
  <em>......</em><br />
  <em>&ldquo;7 in the morning,  Kushal feels a gentle nudge. Waking up to the welcome sight of an old nurse,  Kushal looks around to find the other children yawning. The events of the  previous day are still vague in his mind. All that he remembers and understands  is that a few people dropped by and after a long heated argument with his  master they left only to return back, this time with police. Too sleepy to  realise who these people were, he just went on with them, assuming they were  the elders and they had woke him up for some late night work.&rdquo;</em><br />
  <em>......</em><br />
  The inhumane living conditions and the long exhausting  working hours still haunts Kushal and many other children like himself. With  food as a luxury available maybe twice a day, there are days when children are  starved. Child labour has become a vice that India has started to dread deeply.  With physical and mental abuse a daily routine these young minds provide  breeding grounds for anti-social elements which later may even be moulded into  terrorism. Only a fortunate few make it out of this dark hole. Some succumb to  the harshness of the system, and others to the temptation to the break the system.<br />
  Apart from child labour, cases of rape and molestation have  increases manifold in India in recent times. Naxalism at a time believed to be  suppressed have swung back in full speed too. Substance abuse and communal  violence have also caused chaos in the system. Like salt on a fresh wound,  corruption has deepened the wounds, causing even more pain and suffering.</p>

<h1>Humanity Fights Back</h1>
<p>The youth of the country are, however, becoming increasingly  more aware about these issues and have started to protest against the weak laws  which provide loopholes to the convicted. The recent protest for the Nirbhaya  rape case is an excellent example of this increasing awareness and intolerance  towards injustice among the youth.<br />
  Militants are created from poor accessibility of government  facilities in certain areas leading to their poverty. Though the ideal solution  of this problem should have been the intervention of government for the  betterment of their lives, the anger of the poor tribes has unfortunately  invited extreme measures and resulted in what we see today.<br />
  <em>......</em><br />
  <em>&ldquo;Little had Kushal  realised that it was going to be the last day of his slavery. The inhumane  living conditions and the long exhausting working hours will still haunt him  for many years to come. Life as a labour had been nothing like what he had been  told by the agents who lured him into it. Food was a luxury available only  twice a day, that too if they were lucky. There were days when they would not  be given food even once, if they didn&rsquo;t work hard enough. Shouting and beating  from the masters had become almost a daily affair. They specially dreaded the  days when the masters where in foul mood or sometimes just particularly drunk.  He came to know that they were rescued and rehabilitated by an organisation  called <strong>&ldquo;Bachpan Bachao Andolan&rdquo;</strong>. He  realised that they were not the only ones. The streets of Delhi were filled  with such factories whose glamour at the market came at the price of the lives  of children such as himself.</em><br />
  <em>A week later, he was  watching TV happily with his newly made friends. The face of their father  figure on TV filled his heart with joy.&rdquo;</em><br />

<h1><br />
  Icons to Inspire – Nobel Prize for Peace 2014</h1>
<p>The Bachpan Bachao Andolan is less known to the people of  India, its founder even lesser. Founded in 1980 by the man with a golden heart, <strong><em>Kailash  Satyarthi</em></strong>, the Bachpan Bachao Andolan has been rescuing and  rehabilitating children under bonded labour since the last 25 years. As a boy,  Satyarthi was moved by other children who had to work due to poor financial  condition of their parents and couldn&rsquo;t attend school as a result. He started a  football club with membership fees paying the school fees of needy children, a  project that eventually became a book bank in his town.In 1994, he founded a group  now known as Goodweave, which certifies child-labor-free rugs and provides  assistance to rescued and at-risk children. In 1998, Satyarthi was chairman of  a global march against child labour that wound through more than 60 countries  around the world.<br />
  The mere fact that how less the people of India know him,  and how less media coverage he got despite such great work shows his humility  and selflessness. The Nobel Prize win brought him to the limelight, but it was  never his aim.<br />
  He shared it with <strong><em>Malala Yousafzali</em></strong>, another icon who  advocated the importance of education to all, in spite of threats from Taliban.  Having gone through tremendous suffering and humiliation at a very small age,  her determination is a huge motivation to anyone who knows her. Starting her  journey with the aim of providing education to Pakistani girls, her incident  has sparked a global campaign for girl child education.<br />
  &ldquo;One teacher, one student, one book, and one pen can change  the world.&rdquo; This quote by Malala strongly conveys the importance of education  in the betterment of the lives of girls by making them independent.</p>

<h1>The Ripples of Change</h1>
<p>The people have started to reflect on their actions and look  at their fellow beings. Organisations such as the Bachpan Bachao Andolan which  work against child labour nationally as well as internationally. ActionAid,&nbsp;Oxfam&nbsp;and&nbsp;Education  International are the front-runners in the global march against child labour.  We are proud to have these organisations and support them, but we should also  feel ashamed of the reason why they are needed.<br />
  There are numerous organisations working hand in hand to  global peace. Nuclear warfare, war and its casualties, terrorism have all been  in the cross-hair of these organisations. The extent to which violence and war  has affected the lives of this generation is horrifying, yet the heroic efforts  put in by people to rise up against this, fills every soul with hope and  determination. Deeply affected by this everlasting conflict between peace and  violence the world is going through at present, Kshitij has decided to take  forward this worldwide campaign. </p>

<h1>Kharagpur – The Land of &lsquo;Peace&rsquo;</h1>
<p>The word &lsquo;peace&rsquo; has a very special significance in the life  of KGPians. Going beyond its usual meaning, this word is used in all aspects of  life of a KGPian. Be it exams, parents, sports, cultural activities or any  other such thing. &lsquo;Peace&rsquo; is not just the calmness of mind anymore, rather it&rsquo;s  a way of life. Feeling at ease and in harmony with everyone around you, filled  with compassion and free of all tensions one is truly at &lsquo;peace&rsquo; in IIT  Kharagpur. Inspired by the population and life at IIT Kharagpur, Kshitij brings  you &lsquo;The Peace Campaign&rsquo;. <br />
  We encourage the youth of India to stand up and raise their voices  against the depravities that torture our society. We hope that every voice will  echo through the system and their ripples will become waves of change in the  future. Quoting the legend MJ, &ldquo;Make it a better place, for you and for me and  the entire human race&rdquo;.</p>
